## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What Is an MCP Server?

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a standardized service component that provides "context + tool capabilities" to AI clients such as GitHub Copilot Chat. Instead of relying solely on static prompts, it lets the model fetch data on demand from local or remote systems—files, databases, APIs, script results, domain knowledge bases, and more.

#### Key Advantages
- **Scalable**: a single client can connect to multiple MCP servers (files, databases, logs, deployment platforms, monitoring systems, and so on).
- **Low overhead**: expose existing systems by wrapping them with an adapter—no need for invasive changes.
- **Relevant context**: fetch information only when needed, avoiding prompt bloat and improving response quality.

### How We'll Use It in This Lab

In this lab we will use GitHub Copilot to:
- Draft commit messages and publish the repository to GitHub.
- Retrieve existing issues through the GitHub MCP server and create new ones.

---

## Lab Environment

### Software Requirements
- **Node.js**: >= 22.0.0
- **npm**: >= 10.0.0
- **VS Code**: latest version
- **GitHub Copilot**: signed in

---

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Publish Code to GitHub

#### 1.1 Goal
Prepare the repository and push it to GitHub.

#### 1.2 Procedure

1. **Create the commit**
   Ask GitHub Copilot to suggest a commit message and commit locally.

2. **Push to GitHub**
   Use VS Code to push the repository to GitHub.

#### 1.3 Validation
- The repository is visible on GitHub.

### Step 2: Configure the GitHub MCP Server

#### 2.1 Goal
Set up the GitHub MCP server correctly.

#### 2.2 Procedure
1. **Create `mcp.json`**
   Under `.vscode`, create `mcp.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
      "servers": {
         "github": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
         }
      }
   }
   ```

2. **Start the MCP server**
   Open `mcp.json`, click **Start**, and follow the prompts to authenticate.

3. **Verify available tools**
   Confirm that the `create_issue` and `list_issues` tools are available.

#### 2.3 Validation
- The repository remains accessible on GitHub.

### Step 3: Use the GitHub MCP Server

#### 3.1 Goal
List existing issues and create new ones through the GitHub MCP server.

#### 3.2 Procedure

1. **List existing issues**
   In Copilot Chat (Agent mode) run:
   ```
   which GitHub issues do I have?
   ```
   ![query issues](../images/043.png)

2. **Create a new issue**
   Still in Agent mode, run:
   ```
   create a new issue with title "generate about page for the application" and body "generate about page for the application, and use Playwright to verify the page works"
   ```
   ![create issue](../images/044.png)

3. **Create another issue**
   Run:
   ```
   create a new issue with title "generate detail page for the application" and body "generate detail page for the application. when a user clicks any destination card on the home page, the app should open a destination detail page. use Playwright to verify the page works"
   ```

#### 3.3 Validation
- The newly created issues are visible on GitHub.

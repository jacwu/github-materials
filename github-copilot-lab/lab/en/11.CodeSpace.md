## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What Is GitHub Codespaces?

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that lets you edit and run code directly in the browser. It delivers a full VS Code experience with GitHub integration to simplify collaboration and version control.

### How We'll Use It in This Lab

We will:
- Create a new development environment with GitHub Codespaces.
- Use GitHub Copilot inside the Codespace.
- Run Copilot CLI within the Codespace.

## Lab Environment

### Software Requirements
- **Node.js**: >= 22.0.0
- **npm**: >= 10.0.0
- **VS Code**: latest version
- **GitHub Copilot**: signed in

---

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Launch a GitHub Codespace

#### 1.1 Goal
Start a Codespace and verify Copilot works inside it.

#### 1.2 Procedure

1. **Open the Codespaces entry point**
   - On GitHub.com, open the repository and click the green **Code** button.
   - Switch to the **Codespaces** tab in the pop-up.
   - Click **Create codespace on main** and wait for GitHub to provision the environment.

2. **Use GitHub Copilot**
   - When setup finishes, the browser opens VS Code for the web with Copilot already signed in.
   - Open Copilot Chat, switch to Agent mode, and run:
   ```
   explain the project
   ```

#### 1.3 Validation
- The browser switches to VS Code for the web and Copilot responds successfully.

### Step 2: Use Copilot CLI in the Codespace

#### 2.1 Goal
Run Copilot CLI commands inside the Codespace.

#### 2.2 Procedure

1. **Install Copilot CLI**
   - In the terminal, install Copilot CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @github/copilot
   ```

2. **Start Copilot CLI and verify the connection**
   - Run `copilot`; the CLI connects to the GitHub MCP server and completes authentication.
   - At the prompt, enter `list all the github issues` so Copilot gathers the repository’s issues.

3. **Have Copilot CLI tackle an issue**
   - Continue with `implement the #8 issue`. Replace `#8` with the actual issue number from Lab 5.
   - Wait for Copilot to guide or apply the changes.

4. **Start the dev server to validate changes**
   - Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Copilot monitors whether the server starts correctly.

5. **Expose the forwarded port**
   - Open the Codespaces **Ports** panel and set the port visibility to **Public** so you can access the site from the browser.

6. **Open the site via the forwarded URL**
   - Use the forwarded link that Copilot provides to view the app.

#### 2.3 Validation
- Copilot CLI successfully completes the issue work, the dev server is reachable via the public port, and the page reflects the latest changes.
- Codespaces closes automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- When you reopen the Codespace, the previous changes persist.

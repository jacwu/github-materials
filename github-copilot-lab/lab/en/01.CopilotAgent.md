## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI programming assistant co-developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It can:

- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Automatically generate code based on context
- **Natural Language to Code**: Generate code implementation through requirement descriptions
- **Multi-language Support**: Support multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, etc.
- **Learn Best Practices**: Trained on billions of lines of open-source code to provide high-quality code suggestions

### Advantages of GitHub Copilot

1. **Boost Development Efficiency**: Reduce repetitive code writing and focus on business logic
2. **Lower Learning Curve**: Help quickly master new frameworks and technologies
3. **Code Quality Assurance**: Provide code suggestions that follow best practices
4. **Context-Aware**: Understand project structure and coding style to generate consistent code

### Application in This Lab

In this lab, we will use GitHub Copilot to:
- Generate project structure based on PRD documentation
- Quickly create Vue components and type definitions

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create PRD Document

#### 1.1 Objective
Use GitHub Copilot to generate a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD)

#### 1.2 Operation Steps

1. **Create Project Folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir travel-site
   cd travel-site
   ```

2. **Generate PRD Using Copilot Chat**
   
   Open the created folder travel-site in VS Code, open Copilot Chat, select Agent mode, and enter the following prompt:
   ```
   I want to create a travel website with only one page for browsing destinations.
   Please create a PRD and save it to an md file. The PRD should include website introduction, page functionality description, file directory structure, and
   technology stack (html and tailwind css).
   Note: The website uses responsive design with clear and simple elements. Images needed on the page should be sourced from Unsplash and Pexels as much as possible, with a design style using blue and green colors.
   ```

3. **Save PRD**

   In the Copilot Chat dialog box, click the "keep" button to save the generated PRD document

#### 1.3 Verification
- PRD file has been created
- Document structure is clear and contains all necessary sections

---

### Step 2: Initialize Travel Project

#### 2.1 Objective
Initialize a travel website project based on PRD

#### 2.2 Operation Steps

1. **Add Reference**

   Add a reference to the created PRD file in the GitHub Copilot chat window for reference when generating code later.

2. **Create Project**

   Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, select Agent mode, and enter the following prompt:
   ```
   Please create a website application based on the content of the PRD
   ```

3. **Enable Debug Logs**

   In the upper right corner of VS Code Copilot Chat, click "...", select "Show Chat Debug View"

4. **Open Application**

   Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, select Agent mode, and enter the following prompt:
   ```
   Open the homepage in the browser
   ```

5. **Handle Errors**

   If you encounter any issues with the generated project, continue using Copilot Chat to fix them until the project runs successfully.
   
#### 2.3 Verification
- Website application has been successfully created
- Functionality meets PRD definition
- Observe GitHub Copilot Chat's debug logs to understand how context is passed

## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What Is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI programming assistant co-developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It can:

- **Intelligent code completion**: automatically generate code based on the current context.
- **Natural language to code**: turn requirement descriptions into working code.
- **Multi-language support**: work with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and more.
- **Best-practice guidance**: draw on billions of lines of open-source code to offer high-quality suggestions.

### Benefits of GitHub Copilot

1. **Higher development velocity**: reduce repetitive coding and stay focused on business logic.
2. **Lower learning curve**: get up to speed with new frameworks and technologies faster.
3. **Quality assurance**: receive suggestions that align with community best practices.
4. **Context awareness**: understand your project structure and style so the generated code stays consistent.

### How We'll Use It in This Lab

In this lab we'll ask GitHub Copilot to:
- Generate the project structure from a PRD document.
- Quickly scaffold Vue components and TypeScript types.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create the PRD

#### 1.1 Goal
Use GitHub Copilot to produce a complete product requirements document (PRD).

#### 1.2 Procedure

1. **Create the project folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir travel-site
   cd travel-site
   ```

2. **Generate the PRD with Copilot Chat**

   Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, switch to Agent mode, and run the following prompt:
   ```
   I am building a travel website with two pages: a home page for browsing destinations and a booking page.
   Please create a PRD in Markdown that includes an overview of the site, the feature requirements for each page,
   the file structure, and the tech stack (Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS).
   Note: the site should use responsive design, prefer images from Unsplash and Pexels, and apply a blue and green visual style.
   ```

3. **Confirm the PRD covers**
   - Project overview and target users
   - Home page requirements (hero area, destination cards, filtering)
   - Booking page requirements (form, price calculation, payment options)
   - Design guidelines (blue/green palette)
   - Tech stack description
   - Complete file structure
   - TypeScript data model definitions
   - Image sourcing recommendations

#### 1.3 Validation
- `PRD.md` exists.
- The document is well structured and contains every required section.

### Step 2: Bootstrap the Vue 3 Project

#### 2.1 Goal
Use Vite to create a Vue 3 + TypeScript project and implement the required features.

#### 2.2 Procedure

1. **Reference the PRD**
   In Copilot Chat, add `PRD.md` as a reference so Copilot can reuse the requirements while generating code.

2. **Create the project**
   Staying in Agent mode, run this prompt:
   ```
   Build and start the web app based on PRD.md.
   ```

3. **Handle errors**
   If the generated project has any issues, keep collaborating with Copilot Chat until the project runs successfully.

#### 2.3 Validation
- The web app starts without errors.
- The functionality matches the PRD.

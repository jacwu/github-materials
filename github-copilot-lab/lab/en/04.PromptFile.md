## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What is Prompt File?

GitHub Copilot defines reusable prompts for specific tasks through "Prompt File", thereby improving the consistency and efficiency of the development process. Such files are typically Markdown documents with the .prompt.md extension and are mainly supported in VS Code.

### Application in This Lab

In this lab, we will use GitHub Copilot to:
- Create reusable Prompt File
- Use Prompt File to orchestrate Custom Agent

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create Reusable Prompt File

#### 1.1 Objective
Create reusable Prompt File

#### 1.2 Operation Steps

1. **Create prompts folder**
   ```bash
   cd .github
   mkdir prompts
   cd prompts
   ```

2. **Create form.prompt.md**

   Create form.prompt.md in the prompts folder with the following content and save
   ```  
    ## Goal

    Your goal is to generate a new html page with form.

    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

    ## Requirements

    place all the html, css and js code into a single html file.

    Use appropriate form elements: Select suitable form elements like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc., according to the form's purpose. For the <input> element, use the type attribute to specify its type, such as text, password, email, etc., which enables browsers to provide better input validation and user experience.

    Use the <label> tag: Add a <label> tag for each form element and associate it with the corresponding form element using the for attribute. This improves form accessibility, and users can focus on the corresponding form element when clicking the label.

    Naming of Form Elements: Use meaningful names: Give the name attribute of form elements meaningful names, which facilitates the processing of form data by server-side scripts. The names should be concise and clearly describe the purpose of the form elements.

    Form Validation: Use HTML5 validation attributes: Leverage HTML5 validation attributes such as required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, etc., to perform basic validation on form elements.

    Layout and Typography: Use the box model: Reasonably use box model properties (margin, padding, border) to control the spacing and borders of form elements, ensuring a neat and aesthetically pleasing form layout.

    Responsive design: Consider different device screen sizes and use techniques like media queries to achieve a responsive form layout, ensuring the form is properly displayed and usable on various devices.

    Style and Interaction: Consistent style: Maintain a unified style for form elements, including fonts, colors, button styles, etc., to make the form look coordinated.

   ```

3. **Call Prompt File**

   Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, select Agent mode, and enter the following prompt:
   ```
   /form Elective Course Application Form. The fields include student name, id, grade and target courses
   ```

#### 1.3 Verification

- Target html file is created and meets the requirements in Prompt File


### Step 2: Use Prompt File to Orchestrate Custom Agent


#### 2.1 Objective
Use Prompt File to orchestrate Custom Agent

#### 2.2 Operation Steps

1. **Modify Instructions File**

   Add the following content at the end of the .github/copilot-instructions.md file and save. This will help GitHub Copilot understand the location of custom agents
   ```
   <Custom Agent>  
      All the custom agents are in the `./.github/agents/` directory.
   </Custom Agent>
   ```

2. **Create web2outline.prompt.md**

   Create web2outline.prompt.md in the prompts folder with the following content and save
   ```    
   ## Steps

   1. Call custom agent web2md, save md file into folder ./articles
   2. Call custom agent ouline, save md file into folder ./articles
   ```

3. **Call Prompt File**

   Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, select Agent mode, and enter the following prompt:
   ```
   /web2outline https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/guides/context-engineering-guide
   ```

#### 2.3 Verification
- Two md files are created in the target folder, data source comes from the corresponding URL

## GitHub Copilot Lab

### What Is a Prompt File?

A prompt file is a reusable prompt tailored for a specific task so Copilot can deliver consistent, repeatable output. These files typically use the `.prompt.md` extension and are primarily supported inside VS Code.

### What Is a Custom Chat Mode?

A custom chat mode bundles instructions and tool settings that activate automatically when you switch to that mode. For example, a "Plan" mode might include planning guidance and enable read-only tools. Mode definitions live in `.chatmode.md` files, which you can keep in the workspace for teammates or in personal settings for reuse across projects.

### How We'll Use Them in This Lab

In this lab we will use GitHub Copilot to:
- Create a reusable prompt file.
- Create a reusable custom chat mode.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Build a Reusable Prompt File

#### 1.1 Goal
Create a reusable prompt file.

#### 1.2 Procedure

1. **Create the `.github` folder (if needed)**
   ```bash
   cd .github
   mkdir prompts
   cd prompts
   ```

2. **Create `form.prompt.md`**
   Inside the `prompts` folder, add `form.prompt.md` with the following content and save it:
   ```
   ## Goal

   Your goal is to generate a new HTML page that contains a form.

   Ask for the form name and fields if they are not provided.

   ## Requirements

   Place all HTML, CSS, and JS in a single HTML file.

   Use appropriate form elements: choose elements such as <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and so on, based on the form’s purpose. For each <input>, set its type (text, password, email, etc.) so browsers can apply validation and deliver a better experience.

   Use the <label> tag: add a <label> for each form element and associate it by using the for attribute. This improves accessibility because clicking a label focuses the related input.

   Name elements meaningfully: give each element a concise, descriptive `name` so server-side scripts can process the submitted data easily.

   Form validation: leverage HTML5 attributes such as `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `pattern` to handle basic validation.

   Layout and spacing: rely on the box model (margin, padding, border) to control spacing and produce a clean layout.

   Responsive design: consider different device sizes and use techniques like media queries to ensure the form works across devices.

   Style and interaction: keep typography, colors, and buttons consistent so the form feels cohesive.
   ```

3. **Invoke the prompt file**
   Open Copilot Chat in Agent mode and run:
   ```
   /form Elective Course Application Form. The fields include student name, ID, grade, and desired courses.
   ```

#### 1.3 Validation
- The generated HTML file meets the requirements defined in the prompt file.

### Step 2: Create a Reusable Custom Chat Mode

#### 2.1 Goal
Create a reusable custom chat mode.

#### 2.2 Procedure

1. **Create the `.github` folder (if needed)**
   ```bash
   cd .github
   mkdir chatmodes
   cd chatmodes
   ```

2. **Create `web2md.chatmode.md`**
   Add `web2md.chatmode.md` with the content below and save it:
   ```
   ---
   description: 'You convert web page content into local Markdown files. You extract textual content from web pages and format it into structured Markdown documents.'
   tools: ['createFile', 'createDirectory', 'fetch', 'todos']
   model: Claude Sonnet 4
   ---
   ## Overview
   The user will provide a web page link and a local folder path. The link points to detailed information about a topic. The user also supplies a local folder path indicating where the converted Markdown file should be saved.

   ## Steps
   1. Use the fetch tool to retrieve the web page content.
   2. Extract the text content from the page.
   3. Convert the extracted content into structured Markdown with these requirements:
      - Keep the Markdown language consistent with the original page.
      - Preserve the source content verbatim.
      - Convert headings, sub-headings, lists, code blocks, and similar structures into Markdown equivalents.
      - Exclude metadata or footer content unrelated to the main article (for example: tags, author notes, related posts).
   4. Add two sections at the top of the Markdown file—one for the source link and one for a summary—both using Markdown headings.
   5. Use `createDirectory` if the destination folder does not exist.
   6. Use `createFile` to save the Markdown content to the provided folder. Requirements:
      - Name the file after the topic of the web page.
      - Use the `.md` extension.
      - Save the file to the supplied folder path.
      - Do not modify any existing files.
   ```

3. **Invoke the custom chat mode**
   In Copilot Chat, switch to the `web2md` mode and run:
   ```
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes folder: articles
   ```
   ![Copilot reference example](../images/032.png)

#### 2.3 Validation
- The target Markdown file is created in the destination folder, using the provided URL as the data source.

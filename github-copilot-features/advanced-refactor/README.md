# Advanced Refactoring with GitHub Copilot

This directory contains examples of complex code that can benefit from advanced refactoring patterns with GitHub Copilot's assistance.

## Lab Objectives

- Learn how to identify and refactor code with multiple code smells and anti-patterns
- Use GitHub Copilot to suggest modern architecture patterns and best practices 
- Transform legacy code into maintainable, testable, and scalable solutions

## Exercises

### 1. Legacy Service Refactoring

The `legacy_service.js` file represents a typical legacy service with several issues:

- Global state and side effects
- Callback-based asynchronous code
- Repetitive code blocks and tight coupling
- Lack of proper error handling
- No separation of concerns

**Challenge:** Use GitHub Copilot to refactor this code to:
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Use modern async/await patterns
- Create appropriate class/module structure
- Add proper error handling
- Make the code more testable

### 2. Complex Algorithm Optimization

The `complex_algorithm.py` file contains an inefficient implementation of a data processing algorithm.

**Challenge:** Use GitHub Copilot to:
- Optimize the algorithm for better performance
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve readability without sacrificing functionality
- Add appropriate comments explaining the optimization techniques

### 3. Architectural Refactoring

The `monolithic_app.js` represents a small monolithic application.

**Challenge:** Use GitHub Copilot to:
- Refactor into a microservices or modular architecture
- Apply appropriate design patterns
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Create interfaces between modules

## Using GitHub Copilot for Advanced Refactoring

1. Start by asking Copilot to analyze the existing code and identify issues
2. Ask for recommendations on modern architecture patterns that would fit
3. Break down the refactoring into manageable steps
4. Use inline chat to ask about specific sections of code
5. Have Copilot generate tests to verify the refactored code behaves correctly

## Best Practices for Refactoring with Copilot

- Always understand what the original code does before refactoring
- Break large refactoring tasks into smaller steps
- Verify each change with tests before moving to the next step
- Use Copilot to help identify edge cases you might have missed
- Ask Copilot to explain its refactoring decisions to better understand modern practices
